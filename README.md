## Pomodoro Timer + Website Blocker Extension 

Manifest V3 seems to be the hype term for chromium engines, well it got me excited to learn about it and along the way implement it into building an extension inspired by the StayFocused app (available on PlayStore) which lets you block distracting apps to actually help me stop procrastinating. Being my daily driver for over 3 years now, taught it would be great to have something similar in my browser too (as if Leechblock doesnot exist)

## Features I plan to or rather wish to add
- ~~Flexible Pomodoro Timer -> Lets you decide the session and break length~~ **IMPLEMENTED**
- ~~Sessions Number -> Number of session the timer will run before coming to a hault~~ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Block Site -> Lets you block the distracting websites while the timer is running

## Current Scenario
- Has the ability to start, stop and reset the timer 
- Notifications to inform for the starting and ending of sessions and breaks. Multiple sessions now supported
- Popup menu to select the session and break lenght 

>Hoping For The Best That I don't loose motivation in between of making of this project . Cheers
